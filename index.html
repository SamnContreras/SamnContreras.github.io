            <p class="section--subtitle section--subtitle--about">Web Dev from Utah!</p>

            <div class="about-me-body">
                <p>Me and my family are from tecalitlan jalisco but I grew up in Utah! Growing up I never had an idea of what I wanted to be.
                    Usually it's the classic police offer, fire fighter, astronaut or other great professions but I still wasn't sure. I got into high school and
                    I was set on being a personal financer but after job shadowing one of my family friends I learned it wasn't for me.
                    My brother showed me what coding was in my junior year of high school. I looked into it and  I absolutely
                    loved the idea of creating a website, so after I graduated highschool I worked till I could save up to attend DevMountain and start my coding carrer!
                </p>
                <p>While being a coder in the day i'm a family kid at night! I love to spend time with the poeple I hold dear such as my amazing family and friends.
                    But thats not the only thing I love to do. In my free time you can catch me gaming on my pc playing everything from Minecraft to league of legends to Halo.
                    I'm also guilty of watching sports such as UFC, boxing and both college and proffesional fooball! As a Mexican descendent i'm a huge fan of Brandon Moreno as my favorite UFC fighter,
                    and the boxing GOAT Saul Canelo Alvarez. You can also catch me saturdays watching none other than The Ohio State Buckeyes! Go Bucks!!
